        "name": "facial rejuvenation",
        "what": "Facial Rejuvenation refers to various means and methods to restore a youthful appearance to an aging face. This high-safety procedure helps patients regain their best youthful appearance by removing excess or sagging skin, smoothing deep folds, and lifting and tightening deep facial tissues.",
        "why": "The face is one of the most critical parts of the human body and the most concerned part of the human body. However, when people reach the age of 25, signs of aging usually begin to appear, resulting from the changes in the soft and hard tissues of the face and body. The main symptoms are thin and dry facial skin, reduced elasticity, loss of luster, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, subcutaneous adipose tissue reduction, accumulation, and muscle atrophy. People do not want to look old and usually feel anxious and fearful because of aging. After Racial Rejuvenation, patients can significantly improve their self-confidence because their appearance shows vitality.",
        "options": "Patients can achieve facial Rejuvenation through either surgical or non-surgical options. Surgical (invasive) facial rejuvenation procedures include the mini-facelift or standard facelift. Non-surgical (non-invasive) facial rejuvenation treatments can include chemical peels, neuromodulators (such as botox), laser resurfacing, photorejuvenation, radiofrequency, and ultrasound. The doctor will formulate the regimen and technique of Facial Rejuvenation according to the patient's condition and need.",
        "lifeAfter": "Facial Rejuvenation is a complex procedure requiring excellent surgical skills, but most patients' recovery process is surprisingly quick. Patients usually return to their normal daily activities about two weeks after the treatment (waiting about four weeks for strenuous exercise.) As each patient heals slightly differently, your doctor will provide you with aftercare and recovery detailed instructions. After a facial rejuvenation, bruising and swelling are normal and will peak about two days after the treatment. After that, the bruising and swelling will gradually get better and should be hardly noticeable after about 10 to 14 days. Many patients feel comfortable going public for about a week after surgery. Your doctor can advise you when it is safe to wear camouflage makeup."

        "name": "deep plane facelift",
        "what": "A deep plane facelift is a full facelift procedure that lifts below the smas (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) to tighten the skin and muscle tissue of the face at the same time.",
        "why": "The results of a deep plane facelift are the most comprehensive of any facelift procedure. With a deep plane facelift you can expect to see:\n1. No “surprised” look.\n2. Contouring of the neck.\n3. A more defined jawline.\n4. Fewer wrinkles around the eyes.\n5. Fewer wrinkles along the brows and forehead.\n6. Flattening of deep creases in the nasolabial folds.\n7. Preservation of your cheek definition and facial movements.",
        "options": "Nano Fat Face Lift:\nAs we get older, we can experience loss of subcutaneous fat tissue, creating looser, saggy skin that gives a more aged appearance. Nano fat transfer provides a minimally invasive treatment to improve the fullness of your skin when you’ve experienced a loss in volume. Our skilled professionals use the latest technology to help you renew your look by using small injections of reprocessed fat material from another area of your body, like your lower abdomen, hips, or thighs, to repair the more delicate areas of your skin. The outcome is a softer, rejuvenated appearance with little to no downtime. In addition, because it is your own tissue, it does not cause an allergic reaction and produces long-lasting results with no need for more complicated surgery.\n\nStem Cell Face Lift:\nAdult stem cells are your own natural, versatile substance that regenerates and repairs all areas of your body. Our experienced providers use the newest methods in a nonsurgical approach to manipulate these stem cells to restore your skin where it’s needed when it has experienced damage caused by age or the sun. This minimally invasive treatment acquires stem cells from other places like your abdomen, which are then injected precisely into the areas you want to correct. This natural treatment option has little to no downtime and can offer you an alternative to invasive surgeries while creating successful results you love.",
        "lifeAfter": "You will see immediate results as soon as you remove your bandages. However, swelling and bruising will prevent you from seeing your full results for a few weeks. It can take as long as three months for the “final” results of a deep plane facelift to settle.\n\nThe results of a deep plane facelift are permanent, but aging still happens. Typically, the skin starts to age about a decade after a deep plane facelift to the point where an additional correction may be needed. Lifestyle choices and a proactive care regimen can increase the longevity of these results."

        "name": "eye reshaping",
        "what": "Eye Reshaping includes cosmetic surgery of the upper and lower eyelids, eyebrows, and other parts. It can improve the appearance and shape of the eyes and give them new vitality by lengthening the eyeliner, raising the height of the eyes, adjusting the distance between the eyes, changing the single eyelid to the double eyelid, and lifting the eyelid.",
        "why": "The eyes are one of the most critical parts of the face and determine one's beauty. But everyone's eyes may have defects, such as unsatisfactory size and shape. As age increases, the upper eyelids will droop, and signs of aging will begin to appear. Therefore, choosing the proper eye reshaping treatment can get you the most beautiful and youthful eyes and restore your self-confidence.",
        "options": "There are many treatment options for eye reshaping. Eyelid Lift surgery can improve sagging skin on the upper eyelid, remove puffy eye bags, and restore the natural youthful shape of the eyelid.\n\nBlepharoplasty, also known as \"double eyelid surgery,\" is a type of cosmetic surgery where the skin around the eye is reshaped by changing the single eyelid to a double eyelid. The incision for double eyelid surgery is minimal, almost no scars can be seen, and the surgery can be completed in about ten minutes. It can increase the length of the eyes by 1-3 mm, effectively improving the human eye's size and increasing the eyes' look. \n\nTo achieve an eye contour that matches your natural eye shape and overall appearance, your doctor must have experience and skills in uniquely nuanced procedures. That is because the area around the eye is susceptible. Only a few millimeters of the skin or minor differences in suture technique can make all the difference between a successful aesthetic outcome and unfortunate complications.",
        "lifeAfter": "For the first 1 to 2 weeks after eye reshaping surgery, patients usually experience significant bruising and swelling, and the eyelids may feel unusually tight. Outside exercise can be done in about a week (don't drive until the cosmetic surgeon approves) and return to everyday life after 10-14 days. \n\nUsually, the eyes get tired quickly in the first few weeks, so they need to be rested and try to avoid prolonged use of mobile phones and computers. It is advisable to wear dark-colored sunglasses when going out and apply sunscreen to prevent sun and wind damage. Also, heavy lifting, straining, and stooping to pick things up during the first month must be avoided."

        "name": "fox eyes",
        "what": "At Plastic Surgery Institute, achieving the Fox Eyes look entails two procedures in one surgery: a lateral canthopexy and a brow lift.\n\nCanthopexy involves lifting the outer portion of the lower eyelid with sutures. This creates a refined “cat eye” look and improves the overall eye shape. Brow lifting is necessary so that the brows match the newly improved eye shape. As a bonus, raising the brows corrects heavy upper eyelids and smoothes forehead lines and crow’s feet around the eyes. After the procedure, the outer eyes and brows are harmoniously lifted and firmed, achieving the flirtatious, foxy eyes that have been made famous by some of Hollywood’s A-List starlets.",
        "why": "Droopy eye corners create an overall tired appearance. To open and lift the eyes, the surgeons at Plastic Surgery Institute use their experience and knowledge of facial anatomy to elevate the lateral portion of the eyes and brows.\n\nIt’s incredible what a small change to the eyes can do to give the entire face a fresh, rejuvenated appearance. This innovative eye-and-brow lifting procedure provides a dramatic lifting effect in less time than having the procedures done separately. Patients who undergo surgery have the added benefit of a single recovery period. For our patients in Beverly Hills Fox Eye Surgery recovery usually takes just one to two weeks.",
        "options": "During a Fox Eye Surgery Beverly Hills patients will receive a brow lift and lateral canthopexy simultaneously. First, they lift the outer corners of the lower lid by gently tightening the canthal tendon with sutures. Next, they elevate the forehead skin by performing a brow lift, eliminating periorbital and forehead wrinkles while elevating the brows to a higher position. The surgery takes approximately one to two hours.",
        "lifeAfter": "Recovering after the Fox Eyes surgery at Plastic Surgery Institute is generally swift and uneventful. It takes approximately one to two weeks to make a complete recovery. Mild swelling or bruising may occur. The doctors may advise sleeping with the head in an elevated position to minimize these effects.\n\nAfter the Fox Eye surgery Beverly Hills patients will notice that their eyes appear beautifully lifted at the outermost corners. The brows take on a more taut and rejuvenated appearance while retaining a natural position on the forehead. Upper facial wrinkles, specifically crow’s feet and forehead lines, are all but eliminated. The results last for years, though your body will still age, so the wrinkles will return eventually."

        "name": "rhinoplasty",
        "what": "Rhinoplasty is a plastic surgery procedure for altering and reconstructing the nose. It can improve the nose's shape, size, and symmetry by filling it with autologous, allogeneic tissue or tissue substitutes.",
        "why": "The nose is the most central position of the face, so it is essential to the appearance. But noses can be too big or too small, or the nasal bridge can be bumpy or out of balance with the rest of the face. Rhinoplasty can help you solve these problems, give your nose contour and proportion, and drastically change the dynamics of your face.",
        "options": "Rhinoplasty can be divided into open rhinoplasty and closed rhinoplasty. Open rhinoplasty refers to making an incision on the outside of the nose and then through the external incision to reach the inside of the nose to trim the internal structure of the nose, which is the most significant difference from closed rhinoplasty. Because all incisions for closed rhinoplasty are inside the nose, they cannot be seen outside. Closed rhinoplasty is an operation entirely inside the nose, requiring the doctor's manipulation to be precise and the instruments to be exact and delicate, so the postoperative effect is relatively good, and there are almost no scars.",
        "lifeAfter": "After rhinoplasty surgery, swelling usually begins in 1-2 hours, peaks in 2-3 days, and subsides after a week. The sutures can be removed seven days after the surgery when the nose can recover. It usually returns to nature in 1 to 3 months after the surgery. The surgical incision is generally on the inner edge of one nostril, so the patient should avoid getting it wet when washing their face after surgery. At the same time, patients should pay attention to protecting the nose from external forces after surgery; especially, do not sleep on your side when sleeping to avoid the nose being squeezed."

        "name": "lip enhancement",
        "what": "Lip enhancement refers to the surgical modification of the lips to the desired shape of the lips. It can add or restore volume to the lips and smooth vertical lines around the lips and mouth.",
        "why": "You may be bothered by the appearance of asymmetrical lips, or as you age, your lip becomes thin and lined. Therefore, if you want to plump up your lips, have symmetrical upper and lower lips or smooth lip lines, and make your smile more confident, lip enhancement is a good choice.",
        "options": "There are various treatment options for lip enhancement. The most common is injection/surgical lip augmentation, which injects fillers or artificial dermis into the lips to achieve a lip augmentation effect. The lips will become plump and sexy after surgery. The results of lip augmentation injections are immediate, with minimal side effects, and the durability of the result depends on the type of filler used. Another permanent lip augmentation method is to implant a permanent artificial dermis that is not easily absorbed. During the procedure, needles are inserted through the corners of the lips on both sides to make the lips plumper.",
        "lifeAfter": "Lip enhancement recovery is fast and depends on different treatment options. Most lip enhancement requires only 1 to 3 days of downtime, and some treatments, such as dermal filler lip injections, even require little to no downtime."

    {
        "name": "lip augmentation",
        "what": "Lip augmentation refers to any of several cosmetic techniques and treatments designed to provide smoother, fuller, and radiant lips. Because there are many ways to address signs of aging in the lips such as loss of volume, the plastic Surgery Institute offers a multitude of treatment options. All of which have unique abilities to improve lips and so can be tailored to your aesthetic goals. We want to ensure you get the best lip augmentation Beverly Hills has to offer.",
        "why": "Dermal fillers have experienced an explosion in popularity in the last 20 years. They are injectable substances that produce lift, increase volume, and restore areas of the face that display signs of aging to a more youthful appearance. As we age, we lose volume in critical areas of the face.",
        "options": "Restylane:\nRestylane is a non-animal filler made of stabilized hyaluronic acid that can provide fuller lips and reduce the appearance of wrinkles for as much as 4-6 months. It offers an exciting group of products used in over 40 million treatments worldwide, including a line of hyaluronic acid fillers to give you the natural look you want.\n\nJuvederm:\nJuvederm is another hyaluronic acid filler that provides the highest available substance concentration to give the lips' smoothest enhancement for as long as six months. It is used to preserve facial contours and strengthen aging signs. Juvederm is a dermal filler injectable with a hyaluronic acid-base. It's a treatment that focuses on the forehead, the cheeks, lips, and around the mouth in particular.\n\nCaptique:\nCaptique, the newest hyaluronic product, is a soft tissue filler that enhances the lips, leaving a more natural look. Captique is also non-animal stabilized and is quickly becoming a new favorite among patients for its youthful and long-lasting results. The filler is used to decrease wrinkles around the mouth and nose, and the results are instantaneous. To maintain results, two to three touchups a year are typically required.",
        "lifeAfter": "You can generally expect results from your augmentation session to last about six months with some treatments and up to several years for others. Your doctor will help you decide the best option for you."

    {
        "name": "otoplasty",
        "what": "Otoplasty is also referred to as ear reshaping or ear-pinning. Because the ears are one of the body's first features to reach their final physical size and position, it is not uncommon for young patients who face insecurity over their ears or emotional trauma at school to undergo Otoplasty.\n\nOtoplasty is a safe and effective procedure even in children as young as five or six years of age. Many of the best otoplasty surgeons are located in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. Patients report that Otoplasty performed at a young age may provide better results than older patients. Otoplasty can also be safely performed in adults and remains a very safe procedure in adult patients. Because it is milder than many other forms of cosmetic surgery, adult patients often choose to have Otoplasty performed in conjunction with other facial cosmetic surgeries. The procedure can take place without drastically compromising safety or results.",
        "why": "Having oversized ears can be a cause for great anxiety and stress, especially for young children. Those who lack sensitivity may taunt and add to the problem, leaving the individual feeling down and out of place.",
        "options": "For patients who wish to decrease the ear's size, the skin is open through incisions carefully located at points behind the ear that are easily concealed, although scarring is usually minimal. From here, the cartilage can be shaved and excess skin of the ear can be trimmed when the size of the ear is truly excessive. New ear surgery techniques often allow our surgeons to thread sutures through the skin without the use of large incisions to provide almost completely scar-free results, with far less swelling or bruising and a shorter recovery period.",
        "lifeAfter": "Otoplasty generally requires only local anesthesia, although general anesthesia may be requested or recommended when the surgery is for a child patient. Whether general or local anesthesia is used, adult patients will also need someone to drive them home after surgery and plan to have a driver ready. While healing is not as problematic or extensive as other forms of cosmetic surgery, recovery from Otoplasty also takes an average of one to two weeks.\n\nThere is usually very little postoperative pain. However, during this period, patients can expect bruising, swelling, redness, and discomfort, controlled with the surgeon's medication and taken along with antibiotics. Patients will be able to return to life as usual within a week or so, and the stitches are generally removed after seven days. But patients will be advised to avoid rigorous activity for several weeks while the ears continue to heal and assume their new position.\n\nIf you are a smoker, you are encouraged to refrain before the procedure and during your recovery time. Smoking slows down your blood flow and can adversely affect the healing process. You will also be asked to avoid aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medications that increase the risk of bleeding. While it may be tempting, it is essential to leave any dressing on the affected areas alone. Once your doctor removes it, however, you should see noticeable and immediate results. We greatly value the confidence and trust our patients place in us."

        "name": "chin implants",
        "what": "Chin implants use a small incision in the mouth to place an artificial mandible prosthesis which is sculpted and trimmed according to the subject's facial features and degree of mandibular retraction, and finally achieve the purpose of beautifying the chin.",
        "why": "An even chin and a smooth and balanced facial contour will give people a pleasant appearance. In comparison, a weak chin disrupts the balance of the face, which can make other parts of the face, such as the nose and forehead, look exaggerated. In addition, the chin line is a critical component of the overall shape of the face, and a well-defined chin has long been considered attractive. Chin Implants can improve the chin-to-face ratio, resulting in a sharper and clearer jawline and a more robust profile.",
        "options": "There are many options of materials for chin implants. The most common are firm silicone rubber (Silastic) and more rigid biocompatible materials such as Medpor. The former are prefabricated implants that usually do not require modification by the surgeon. The latter is in pieces and needs to be sculpted and contoured by the surgeon before insertion.",
        "lifeAfter": "Patients must sleep with their heads up to protect the incision and control post-operative swelling for at least one to two weeks after surgery. Typically, chin implants have about two weeks of downtime and no strenuous activity for 3-4 weeks. Patients will achieve the final results of the surgery within a month, and the patient's facial appearance will continue to stabilize over the next few months. During this time, the patient is advised to have a post-operative visit to check the procedure's progress."

        "name": "neck contouring",
        "what": "Loose skin or excess fat on the neck can make people look old. There are many treatments of neck contouring that can improve the condition of the neck, including liposuction of the neck, a submental neck lift, and a full neck lift.",
        "why": "As an exposed part, the neck can also tell people's age. It also shows signs of aging, including wrinkles, skin laxity, thin skin, and submental fullness, or the \"double chin.\" Neck contouring can tighten underlying tissues and musculature, remove excess skin, and reposition the skin for a smoother-looking, more natural jawline appearance.",
        "options": "Neck contouring has many treatment options. Neck lift surgery is one of the most well-known, which involves cervicoplasty (to remove excess skin) or platysmaplasty (to tighten loose neck muscles) to tighten sagging neck muscles and remove excess, sagging skin, restoring a smoother, firmer, and clearer appearance to the neck. The other is neck liposuction, which is liposuction to remove excess fat for a clearer, more elegant neckline.",
        "lifeAfter": "Patients with a neck lift can return to their daily activities within two weeks. However, they may experience tightness in the neck for a few weeks, along with bruising and swelling. Usually, visible bruising disappears after the first week.\n\nPatients with neck liposuction should wear a special support chin strap for about 3 or 4 days and can return to work within one week. Some swelling and bruising also occur after neck liposuction but should resolve within 10 to 14 days after the procedure."

        "name": "co2 laser resurfacing",
        "what": "CO2 laser skin resurfacing is a safe, non-invasive procedure that helps rebuild and rejuvenate your skin while reducing unwanted blemishes and scarring. It essentially tricks your skin cells into creating new cells, so your body can replace damaged areas on its own. By addressing the skin at the cellular level, we can effectively turn back time on your skin and produce a more youthful and radiant appearance. Just three to five 30-minute sessions can give you a dramatic improvement in your skin and a boost to your confidence level.",
        "why": "CO2 laser resurfacing using the Fraxel laser offers a variety of potential benefits to patients:\n 1. Relatively comfortable treatment that typically takes one hour or less to complete\n 2. Ability to address numerous concerns in a single procedure\n 3. Produces a smoother, revitalized complexion\n 4. Noticeable reduction in imperfections like age spots, fine lines and shallow scars\n 5. Some patients enjoy considerable results after a single treatment session\nBenefits and results will vary somewhat from patient to patient and will also be based on the severity of your concerns and the amount of correction you hope to achieve.",
        "options": "Our CO2 resurfacing system known as Fraxel uses fractionated technology to stimulate skin rejuvenation in a less invasive way than ablative laser procedures. This process addresses small areas of skin at a time, leaving surrounding skin and tissue untouched. The fractional nature of the procedure offers the dual benefit of promoting the body’s natural rejuvenating processes while allowing for quicker recovery after treatment. The procedure is also more comfortable for patients, ensuring a positive experience and superior results.",
        "lifeAfter": "When you leave our office after your Fraxel treatment, your skin will likely look red and feel tender like a sunburn. These side effects may subside within a few hours or linger for a couple of days, depending on the depth of your procedure and how your body heals. Dr. Barrett will provide you with instructions on how to care for your skin during this vulnerable time, including applications of ice to minimize swelling and topical moisturizers designed to promote healing to the dermis. Most patients will not feel comfortable returning to social situations for a day or two until these side effects have resolved.\n\nThe results of your Fraxel CO2 laser can be seen both immediately and over time. Within the first few days after your procedure, you may notice that your skin is softer, smoother, brighter and more evenly toned. These improvements will become magnified over the next three to six months as your skin starts to create new collagen and skin cell renewal. While some individuals will achieve satisfying results after a single treatment, most will need a series of sessions for optimal results. Dr. Barrett will advise you as to how many treatments you might need and how far apart they should be spaced to obtain the best possible outcome."

        "name": "breast augmentation",
        "what": "Breast augmentation is a surgery that inserts silicone or saline breast implants to enlarge the size and change the shape of the breasts.",
        "why": "Have you felt inferior because your breasts are too small? Breast augmentation helps you to have fuller and bigger breasts, improves the natural proportions of your breasts, and creates a more symmetrical, aesthetically pleasing breast contour. Not only can it restore the fullness lost after pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it can also give you a more sexy body.",
        "options": "The option for breast augmentation materials is very diverse. The most common are Saline, Silicone Gel, and autologous fat. Patients can also choose an incision according to the doctor's advice. Usually, the incision will be in the inframammary, peri-areolar, trans-axillary, or transumbilical. It is recommended to consult a doctor according to the patient's situation for specific material selection and incision techniques.",
        "lifeAfter": "After breast augmentation surgery, patients usually feel pain and discomfort, depending on the patient's condition and surgery techniques. Usually, pain should be maintained for about two to three days, and the swelling should subside in about one to two weeks. Daily activities can be resumed two to three days after the surgery, and back to work can be resumed after five to seven days. Patients should avoid raising their arms and lifting heavy objects for the first week after surgery. Strenuous exercise is not allowed until two weeks after surgery.

        "why": "A woman's breasts may drop due to the natural effects of aging, genetics, gravity, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or weight loss. A breast lift can help restore a youthful figure and lift breasts that have drooped or lost volume and firmness to regain their youthful radiance.",
        "options": "The option for breast lift incision techniques is very diverse. For example, Crescent lift's technology corrects minimal drooping with minimal scarring, allowing doctors to remove excess skin and reshape the entire breast with modest, easily concealed scarring. A vertical or \"lollipop\" lift is usually recommended for larger drooping, which allows the doctor to remove excess skin and reshape the entire breast with a modest, easily concealed scar. It is recommended to consult a doctor according to your situation for specific incision techniques.",
        "lifeAfter": "After a breast lift, patients usually will feel pain and discomfort, depending on the patient's condition and surgery techniques.

Typically, the procedure calls for the surgeon to remove the implants first and then remove all of the capsule tissue. A capsulotomy is a procedure that can be done open or closed. The open option features the capsule being partially or completely taken out through an incision within the breast area. The closed choice has the surgeon break down the capsule tissue while leaving the implant in place, a procedure that has a greater risk of rupturing the implant.",

It can achieve remarkably natural-looking and feeling results.\n\nHowever, if you are very lean, you may not have enough fat to harvest, and buttock implants may be the only way to achieve your desired size increase. Buttock implants may be a good option for some patients; however, it is vital to understand the added risks of having implants, including capsular contracture and a higher risk of infection. Buttock implants can also look less natural than a skillfully performed Brazilian butt lift.",
        "lifeAfter": "1. After surgery, you should rest in bed for several days.\n2. Eat more vegetables and fiber-rich foods within half a month after the operation to prevent constipation.\n3. Generally, the sutures are removed two weeks after the operation, patients should not perform intense exercise within one month, and patients should fix the elastic bandage under pressure within three months."

        "name": "tummy tuck",
        "what": "A tummy tuck is a surgical procedure that removes excess fat and skin and can build up weak muscles to give you a smoother and firmer abdominal profile. Abdominoplasty is popular with women, especially after pregnancy, dealing with their midsection that has been extended and stretched because of childbirth.\n\nThe abdominal muscles can be split into two halves with multiple pregnancies and big weight gain pulls them apart. A tummy tuck rectifies the saggy issue by getting rid of loose and excess skin and fat to tighten the abdominal muscles in the process. By removing the fat cells from the middle and lower parts of the stomach, it narrows the waistline and stitches the underlying muscle and tissue together creating a more fit appearance to the abdomen.",

        "lifeAfter": "You can expect your abdomen to be swollen and to feel discomfort for a few days. How quickly you recover will depend on your existing health, especially the strength of your abdominal muscles. Your stitches will be removed within a week while deeper sutures are taken out after two or three weeks.\n\nSome people return to work a couple of weeks after their surgery while others need up to four weeks for a full recovery. Light exercises are encouraged to assist with the healing process because it decreases swelling and lowers the chance of blood clots. However, strenuous exercises should wait a few weeks until you feel ready to start using your abdominal muscles again.\n\nYour abdominal scars may appear worst at first. It can take a few months for scars to heal properly and up to a year before."

        "name": "arm lift",
        "what": "Brachioplasty procedures, known commonly as arm lifts, can help reshape the upper arm for a more cosmetically-pleasing appearance. The operation is particularly beneficial for loose and excess skin since exercise and even liposuction will not adequately correct the problem.",
        "why": "Different factors, including aging, weight fluctuations and sun exposure, can lead to significant changes to the upper arm over time. As the skin becomes lax and begins to hang down underneath the upper arms, a “bat wing” look can start to develop. Particularly common in women, these changes can make them feel self-conscious in sleeveless garments and bathing suits. Surgical correction is usually needed to reverse the “bat wing” effect and restore a smoother, more sculpted contour to the upper arm.",
        "options": "TRADITIONAL ARM LIFT\nThis procedure usually involves an incision that stretches down the underside of the arm from the armpit to the elbow. Loose skin is excised, and tissue can also be removed to create a naturally smooth contour.\n\nMINI ARM LIFT\nThis technique is restricted to patients that do not have as much skin that needs to be removed. A smaller incision is necessary to create the desired results, which are not as a dramatic as what you can expect with a traditional arm lift. \n\nLIPOSUCTION AND RADIOFREQUENCY SKIN TIGHTENING\nLiposuction is a less invasive surgical procedure that removes stubborn fat deposits from the underside of the upper arm that have not reduced through exercise efforts. Liposuction eliminates fat cells in the area using a narrow tube called a cannula and gentle suction action. Liposuction can be used alone or at the same time as either of the two procedures above to optimize your final look. It can also be used with radiofrequency skin tightening devices such as venus legacy that will help tighten the skin after the fat is removed.",
        "lifeAfter": "You will experience some soreness for the first few days following surgery, with swelling and bruising that can last up to one month after your procedure. To ensure optimal results, Doctor recommends resting for at least one to two weeks to give the surgical site ample time to heal and avoid potential bleeding around the incisions. Movements will be limited due to compression dressings and elastic bandages used to cover your incisions."
